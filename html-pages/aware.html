  <p>
    My personal experience, along with those of many friends and relatives, points to significant gaps and bad practices in this area. Some major issues are:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>When the family is already engaged in taking care of their loved ones, it is extremely difficult to evaluate and find a reliable, experienced, and compassionate nurse.</li>
    <li>Middlemen charge hefty amounts from patients, which often end up in their pockets instead of compensating the hardworking nurses for their selfless service.</li>
    <li>These middlemen sometimes create different grades of nurses without proper disclosure. They exploit patients' urgency, introducing lower-grade nurses as top-grade ones, charging patients heavily while paying the nurses minimally. This not only cheats patients financially but also jeopardizes their lives.</li>
    <li>Regardless of the requirement, most middlemen charge for a minimum of 15 days (in multiples of 15) and demand advance payment.</li>
    <li>Many honest, hardworking, compassionate, and selfless nurses struggle to find jobs, and even when they do, they are often underpaid.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Through this platform, we aim to achieve the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Firstly, we aim to make patients aware of prevailing malpractices in this area so they can receive the best care they deserve at an affordable price, no matter where they get the service.
    </li>
    <li>
      Secondly, we strive to eliminate middleman commissions, charging minimal fees at our end, and ensuring most of the payment goes to the deserving nurses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Thirdly, we provide a fair platform where the most deserving and experienced nurses can offer their best services to the most needy.
    </li>
  </ul>
